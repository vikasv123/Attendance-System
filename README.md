##### The implementation of this attendance system is based on Flask, face_recognition library, and OpenCV technologies. Flask provides a robust web framework that enables the creation of a user-friendly interface for interacting with the attendance system. The face_recognition library offers advanced face detection, encoding, and recognition capabilities. OpenCV serves as a powerful tool for image processing and manipulation, facilitating real-time video feed analysis.
##### The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient system that can automatically identify individuals based on their facial features and record their attendance. The system employs a pre-defined set of known face encodings, which are obtained by encoding facial images of individuals who are expected to be present. These encodings serve as reference points for comparison during the recognition process.
##### Utilizing the live video feed captured from a webcam, the system applies face detection algorithms to identify and locate faces within each frame. Subsequently, face encodings are computed for the detected faces. By comparing these encodings with the pre-loaded known face encodings, the system determines the identity of each individual. Upon successful recognition, the system records the attendance of the identified individuals, along with their corresponding timestamps, in a CSV file.
##### The attendance data can be easily visualized through a web-based interface, which displays a table containing the recorded attendance information. This user-friendly presentation allows administrators, educators, or any authorized personnel to conveniently access and analyze attendance records.
##### The implementation of the Automated Face Recognition-Based Attendance System offers numerous benefits. It reduces the administrative burden associated with manual attendance processes, minimizes errors, and provides accurate attendance records in real-time. Furthermore, it enhances overall efficiency and productivity, as valuable time and resources that were previously dedicated to attendance tracking can now be allocated to other tasks.
